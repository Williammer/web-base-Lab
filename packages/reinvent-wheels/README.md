# Web base laboratory

The warm-bed for my Web fundamental experiments.

It includes my trying-out of interesting new Web technologies, classic wheels reinventing, and some experiments out of creative thoughts.

Wheels reinvented:

- Two way databinding implemented with either `defineProperty` or `ES6 Proxy`.

- ES6 Promise.
